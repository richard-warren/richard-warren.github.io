title: cellfie finds cells in microscopy data

excerpt: â€‹Neuroscientists use [calcium imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_imaging){:target="_blank"} to monitor the activity of large populations of neurons in awake, behaving animals (like in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxa19uWC_oA){:target="_blank"} beautiful example). However, calcium imaging can be very noisy, making neuron identification challenging. I use a two-stage convolutional neural network approach to find neurons in noisy data. I'm collaborating with [Eftychios Pnevmatikakis](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/eftychios-a-pnevmatikakis/){:target="_blank"} at the Simon's Foundation to see if this approach combined with standard matrix factorization techniques outperforms current calcium imaging segmentation algorithms.
