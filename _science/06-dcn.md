title: stop listening to yourself!

excerpt: "Many neuroscientists fall into one of two camps: those who figure out how the brain controls the body, and those who figure out how the brain processes sensory information. However, some of the coolest stuff occurs at the intersection between sensation and action. For example, how does the brain distinguish sensations generated by our own actions (like the sound of our footsteps) from those caused by things in the world (like the sound of a predator sneaking up to eat you!)? [In Nature Neuroscience, we show](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530663/) how a little brain region in mammals tunes out the sounds of animals' own behavior, potentially enhancing their ability to detect critical sounds from the outside world."
