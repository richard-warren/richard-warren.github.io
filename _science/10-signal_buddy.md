title: open source scientific signal generator
image: /images/portfolio/signal_buddy.gif
excerpt: Scientists often need to generate temporally precise electrical signals to control devices around the lab (lasers, cameras, current generators, etc). Most signal generators are big, expensive, and difficult to operate. I designed an easy-to-use, open source signal generator - [`SignalBuddy`](https://github.com/richard-warren/SignalBuddy) - that can be made for ~$20 in parts. SignalBuddy has a nice 3D printed enclosure and replaces expensive signal generators in many lab applications.
