title: what fish brains tell us about how we move
image: /images/portfolio/conb_review.png
excerpt: With neuroscientists working on topics as diverse as the [eyes of flies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3799), [the guts of mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2016.107), and [the neural basis of free will](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2497), it's easy to get the impression that the field is engaged in what Ernest Rutherford ([probably, and derisively](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/05/08/stamp/)) called "stamp collecting" - amassing facts about the world without uncovering general principles from which deeper understanding emerges. A nice counter-example comes from [Nate Sawtell's](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/nathaniel-sawtell-phd) work on electric fish. In an incredible case of convergent evolution, a brain region that helps a strange fish detect electricity bears remarkable similarity to the cerebellum, a motor control brain region in mammals. [In this review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27504860/) Nate Sawtell and I argue that both brain regions implement the same underlying algorithm, and we show how it can be leveraged both for sensory processing and the control of movement.
