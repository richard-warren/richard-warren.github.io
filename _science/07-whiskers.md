title: to measure whisker movements
image: /images/portfolio/whiskers.gif
excerpt: Some neuroscientists study sensation, and some study action. However, most animal behavior lies in the murky area between these extremes. The whisker movements mice use to sense their environment illustrate how perception and action are inextricably linked. [Chris Rodgers](https://chris-rodgers.com/index.html) studies such 'active sensation' by recording the brains of mice while they explore objects with their whiskers. I worked with Chris to build a convolutional neural network that measures the movements of individual whiskers with high fidelity. This approach avoids the heavy handed feature engineering of previous algorithms and also makes for some really cool videos!
