â€‹I teamed up with the group behind DeepLabCut (covered in The Atlantic), a revolutionary neural network based tool for analyzing videos. While neural networks have been transformative in many domains, their computational complexity limits their utility when dealing with huge datasets. We improved the speed of DeepLabCut up to tenfold, allowing even large datasets to be analyzed with consumer level GPUs.
