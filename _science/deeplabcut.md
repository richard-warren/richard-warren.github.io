title: need for speed in convolutional neural networks
image: /images/portfolio/dlc.gif
excerpt: â€‹I teamed up with the team behind DeepLabCut ([covered in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/deeplabcut-tracking-animal-movements/564338/)), a revolutionary neural network tool for video analysis. Neural nets have been transformative in many domains, but their computational complexity limits their utility on huge datasets. [We improved the speed of DeepLabCut up to tenfold](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/457242v1), allowing even large datasets to be analyzed with consumer level GPUs. The GIF here shows DeepLabCut tracking mouse movements in [my open-source motion tracking system](https://hackaday.io/project/160744-kinemouse-wheel).
