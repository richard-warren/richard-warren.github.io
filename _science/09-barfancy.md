title: fancy bar plots for hierarchical data
image: /images/portfolio/barfancy.png
excerpt: â€‹Just because your data are terrible doesn't mean they can't look great! I often analyze data with complex hierarchical structures. Making nice bar plots that capture relationships in multi-factorial designs can require annoying nested for loops that are difficult to modify. I developed [`barFancy`](https://github.com/richard-warren/barFancy){:target="_blank"}, a Matlab function that requires only a single tensor as input. It produces pretty bar and/or [violin plots](https://blog.bioturing.com/2018/05/16/5-reasons-you-should-use-a-violin-graph/){:target="_blank"} with tons of visualization options.
