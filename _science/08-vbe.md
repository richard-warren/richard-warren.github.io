excerpt: The human brain is a complicated machine. With 100 billion neurons churning away throughout ours lives, it's unsurprising that some of what goes on under the neural hood occurs without our awareness. With modern neuroimaging techniques we can ask what happens in the brain when we processes information unconsciously. During my undergraduate thesis [we presented subliminal images of spiders to people with arachnophobia while scanning their brains](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28165171/). Remarkably, spider images activated emotional centers in the brain without causing feelings of fear. The coolest part? This procedure actually [increased phobics' willingness to interact with a real tarantula](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235728191_The_effect_of_very_brief_exposure_on_experienced_fear_after_in_vivo_exposure), suggesting that techniques like [exposure therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy) may be effective even when exposure occurs subliminally.
