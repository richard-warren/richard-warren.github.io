title: open source motion capture

excerpt: New tools [keep popping up](open-ephys.org/neuropixels) that allow neuroscientists to record from greater numbers of neurons in the brain. For those of us who wish to understand how the brain controls behavior, we need to make sure our measurements of behavior keep pace with our measurements of neural activity. I designed [an open source running wheel](https://hackaday.io/project/160744-kinemouse-wheel) for mice that facilitates 3D reconstruction of body pose. This wheel is currently being using by labs around the world. With a single camera, access to a laser cutter, and a small number of parts you can achieve kinematic analyses that previously required thousands of dollars worth of cameras and software.
