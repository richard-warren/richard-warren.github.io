I use and develop machine learning tools to understand how brains control behavior. In 2021 I will be interning at [Google's DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/){:target="_blank"}, then [Facebook Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/){:target="_blank"}, then completing my neuroscience PhD at Columbia University.
