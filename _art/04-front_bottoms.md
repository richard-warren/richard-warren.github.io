excerpt: Of all the bands I've worked with, [The Front Bottoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Front_Bottoms){:target="_blank"} are the guys who really made it big. New Jersey's favorite folk-punk band now sells out venues around the world, tours with Blink-182, and is signed to [one of the world's best rock labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fueled_by_Ramen){:target="_blank"}. I produced and mixed their [EP Liberty and Prosperity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWFT5M7FTWk){:target="_blank"}.
