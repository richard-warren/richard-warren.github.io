excerpt: "While starting grad school I was wrapping up production on a pretty dense album. The arrangements are a little different: Americana style instrumentation (acoustic guitar, banjo), paired with classical string arrangements and ambient electric guitars. When I finished, my brother Jon helped me make a single-shot, album-length music video in which I illustrate the lyrics of the album on the walls of our childhood bedroom."
