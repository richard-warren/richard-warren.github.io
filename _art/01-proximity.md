excerpt: While starting grad school I wrapped up my last big music project&#58; a full length album with Americana style instrumentation (acoustic guitar, banjo, upright bass), paired with classical string arrangements and ambient electric guitars. My brother Jon helped me make a single-shot, album-length music video in which I illustrate the lyrics of the album on the walls of our childhood bedroom.
