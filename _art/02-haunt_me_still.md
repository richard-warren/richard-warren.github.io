title: haunt me still

excerpt: Some people romanticize sudden bursts of inspiration that fuel songs, poems, or even books (think [On the Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Road){:target="_blank"}). However, I'm a big believer in working hard at one's craft to produce the best work (in both art and science). Rewrite! Workshop! Edit! Optimize! This recording is an exception. I wrote and did a live recording of this song in one night and am still happy with how it came out.
