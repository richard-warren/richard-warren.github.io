excerpt: "[Thank You Scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_You_Scientist) makes super weird, super mathy rock music with absurd performance technicality. I recorded and mixed their debut EP, [The Perils of Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_Dv25KmPE&list=PLpZzCI8A084t8GJNGbeZC3B4xPZ8WbTs9&index=4&t=0s)."
