This is the code for my personal website, which is forked and modified from the excellent [academic pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

## notes on mods
- **to change font:** change `$rick-font` in `_sass\_variables.scss`
- **to change accent color:** change `$accent-color` in `_sass\_variables.scss`
- **science and art hacks:** created `archive-portfolio.html`, modified from `archive-single`. it shows images to the left of text, with titles above (see the text beneath the `rick mod` comment in that file).
